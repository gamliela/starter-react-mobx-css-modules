# starter-react-webpack

My starter kit for projects based on React and Webpack.

This kit consists of the latest versions of:

- React
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- SCSS
- CSS Modules
- ESLint (with `react-hooks` plugin)
- Prettier

#### Start Development Server

```
$ yarn dev
```

#### Lint with ESLint

```
$ yarn lint
```

#### Prettify with Prettier

```
$ yarn prettify
```

#### Build Instructions

```
$ yarn build
```

The output goes to `/build/bundle.js` & `/build/index.html`
